XDominion for GO v0
=============================

The XDominion library is used to build object instead of queries to access any database. Queries are build on demand based on the type of database. Do not write queries anymore, but use objects.

Because you need to compile the database drivers directly into the code, 
XDominion support only posgresql in this version. More databases will be supported later.
